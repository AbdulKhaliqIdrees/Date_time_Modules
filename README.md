In this Project: Understanding Time and Datetime Modules in Python
Overview
In this project, I learned about the time and datetime modules in Python, which are essential for handling date and time operations. This included exploring various functions and methods for working with time and date, formatting and comparing dates, and implementing delays.
Topics Covered
Time Module
The time module provides various time-related functions:
time(): Returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).
ctime(): Converts a time expressed in seconds since the Epoch to a string representing local time.
localtime(): Converts a time expressed in seconds since the Epoch to a struct_time representing local time.
Datetime Module
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times:
datetime(): Constructs a new datetime object.
date(): Constructs a new date object.
time(): Constructs a new time object.
sleep(): Delays execution for a given number of seconds.
datetime.today(): Returns the current local date and time.
datetime.now(): Returns the current local date and time.
date.today(): Returns the current local date.
timedelta(): Represents the difference between two dates or times.
strftime() and Formatting Datetime
strftime(): Converts a datetime object to a string based on a specified format. Formatting codes such as %Y, %m, %d, %H, %M, %S, and more are used to represent the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.
Comparison of Two Dates
Comparison operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=) can be used to compare two datetime or date objects to determine the chronological order or equality.
